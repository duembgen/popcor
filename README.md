# POPR: Polynomial OPtimization for Robotics

A toolbox for setting up and solving polynomial optimization problems in robotics with certifiable optimality.

## Purpose

This toolbox includes methods to formulate and solve polynomial optimization problems in robotics. 
The focus of this toolbox is on creating **tight** semidefinite relaxations, which means that we can
replace difficult (often NP-hard) optimization problems by easier-to-solve convex problems. In doing so, we can identify globally optimal solution of the original problem. 

The toolbox allows to run the *AutoTight* and *AutoTemplate* algorithms on problems of your choice. 
These algorithms are described in detail in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05783/). For a high-level overview of how this works, please refer to the **Quick start guide**.

## Who this tool is for

This tool is created for engineers (in particular, roboticists) who want to test if an optimization problem they need to solve could be amenable to certifiable optimization. For many problems, it has been shown that random initialization can lead to convergence to poor minima, while the same problems admit a so-called **convex relaxation** which allows to solve it to global optimality (or certify local solutions). This tool is meant to help you try quickly if your current problem also belongs to this family of problems that can be solved to certifiable global optimality. 

## Dependencies

Besides the automatically installed dependencies when using the above instructions, you need to also have a valid MOSEK license in order to use this repository. If you are an academic, you can get a license for free [here](https://www.mosek.com/license/request/?i=acp).

## What this tool can and cannot do

This tool can be seen as a bridge between the mathematical problem formulation and the algebraic modeling languages (AMLs). AMLs take as an input the *mathematical problem* written by a user, and convert it to a standard form [`[1]`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03447). One of the most well-known AMLs is for example shipped with [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/). However, coming up with the *mathematical problem* is sometimes a challenge in itself.

In certifiable optimization, for example, we typically solve an SDP that was derived as the rank relaxation or Lagrangian dual of an original, non-convex problem. Finding the correct SDP can be however quite difficult! For example, one might have to add many constraints to the SDP that are redundant for the original non-convex problem but change the solution of the relaxation, making it more "tight". 

Currently, this tool is focused on tightening relaxations by finding redundant constraints. There are however numerous extensions that a powerful "bridge" should also include and that are topics of ongoing research. For example, interesting features to this toolbox would be:

- Problem conditioning: applying a coordinate transform to improve the convergence properties of the problem.
- Data-driven modeling: deriving the correct problem formulation directly from data.
